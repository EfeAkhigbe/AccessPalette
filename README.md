# AccessPalette 

AccessPalette is a tool that helps designers and developers choose accessible text and background color combinations that meet WCAG standards. It not only validates contrast ratios but also suggests alternative accessible colors and provides a real-time preview to improve decision-making.


## Features

- **Accessibility Checker**: Validates color contrast against WCAG 2.1 (AA and AAA).
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends accessible text or background colors based on input.
- **Live Preview**: See what your text will look like on various background colors in real time.
- **Flexible Input**: Enter either a text color or a background color and the tool handles the rest.
- **User-Friendly**: No need for trial and error, get informed suggestions fast.


## Why AccessPalette?

Over **2.2 billion people** worldwide have some form of visual impairment. Roughly **8% of men** and **0.5% of women** are colorblind. Designing with poor contrast or relying solely on color can exclude these users from engaging with your product.

> Websites that fail to meet WCAG standards risk excluding more than **15% of their potential audience**, resulting in lower engagement, poor conversion rates, and even legal consequences in accessibility-compliant regions.

**AccessPalette** makes accessibility simple, smart, and seamless for everyone.
