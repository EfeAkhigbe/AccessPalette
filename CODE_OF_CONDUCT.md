# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

At AccessPalette, we believe that great ideas come from diverse voices working together in a supportive space.

We are committed to fostering a community where everyone feels respected, heard, and encouraged. Contributions in any form, design, code, writing, feedback, or curiosity are valued here. 
This is a space built on kindness, collaboration, and inclusion, where all contributors can grow without fear of exclusion or unfair treatment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes  
- Focusing on what is best for the community, not just ourselves

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior.  
They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it using our [Code of Conduct Violation Report Form](https://example.com/report-form).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly by the project team.
